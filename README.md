# Modulo7
A semantic and technical analysis of musical scores based on Information Retrieval Principles

Pipeline Usage:

1. $ perl build_song_sources_crawler.pm
This creates song_sources.txt

2. $ perl music_score_crawler.pm
Reads song_sources.txt and creates .nsf and .lyrics files

3. $ perl lyrics_analyzer.pm
Reads .lyrics files. Menu driven and self explanatory

4. $ perl notes_analyzer.pm
Reads .nsf files. Menu driven and self explanatory

5. $ rm *.lyrics *.nsf
To clean up workspace of data files, optionally remove song_sources.txt

Performing frequency analysis:

1. The software used is "Sonic Visualiser" with the plugin "Melodia".

2. Open any song and apply the transformation using the plugin.

3. Save the layer generated by the plugin as a text file.

4. $ perl aggr.prl
Converts the raw frequency in the text file into its equivalent stream of musical notes.

5. The result of the above operation can be fed to note_analyzer.pm
