Similarity measures for Music theoretic criteria

This document consists a description of all the similarity measures that are addressed by Modulo7

In that respect a good vector representation needs to be developed for the same.

Various vector space representation for this regard as the follows :-

1. TonalHistogramVector - A vector representation of a document that considers bins of intervals.
2. Perfect/Minor/Major triple vector - A condensed vector representation that takes into account

Adopting traditionAal IR approaches to music representation can be difficult. For that a documentation scheme is needed.
I present my own documentation scheme (depending on tokenization of standard literature)

1. All notes will have their standard meaning. A, A#, B, C, ,C#  D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, penalty of transformation is defined based on horizontal
interval distance

2. All chords will be note appended by a suffix denoting chord type. The types are maj, min, dim etc. So an example token would be Emaj.

This information Points one and two are per voice. Each voice is a sequence of such voice preceded by a voice index.

3. Title, Artist, Album, Key signature, Time Signature, Tempo and other parameters can be considered as time signature can be considered
as title and other header information for the document. As such they can be queried separately
