YOU CAN THINK OF THIS FILE AS THE README OF THE ALGEBRA ASSOCIATED WITH THE QUERYING ENGINE. THIS WOULD ALSO DISCUSS
THE VARIOUS STATISTIC OPERATIONS THAT COULD BE ACQUIRED FOR THE MODULO7 REPRESENTATION.

CERTAIN BASIC STATISTICS THAT COULD BE USED :-

1. MELODIC COMPLEXITY - THE RATIO OF THE LONGEST REPEATING PHRASE TO THE TOTAL LENGTH OF THE SONG.
2. HARMONIC COMPLEXITY - THE LONGEST CHORD SEQUENCE IN THE SONG.
3. MELODIC ARCH/CONTOUR - GROSS CONTOUR OR STEINBECK CONTOUR OF THE MELODIC ARCH OF A SONG

OPERATIONS TO BE SUPPORTED :-

SELECT - SIMILAR TO A SQL SELECT BUT SELECTS A TYPE OF SOURCE, INPUT ALLOWED WOULD BE : MIDI, PNGSHEET, MUSICXML, MP3
PROJECT - DRILL DOWN TO A PARTICULAR VOICE SUPPORTING A CRITERIA OR A STATISTIC
WHERE - ASSERT BEGINNING OF A BLOCK OF ALGEBRA (BOOLEAN MIX OF STAT AND CRITERIA)
AVG(STAT) - AVERAGED STATISTIC OVER ALL VOICES IN THE SONG - RETURNS EITHER A DOUBLE OR A VECTOR OF DOUBLE
MAX(STAT) - MAXIMUM OVER ALL THE VOICES IN THE SONG - RETURNS EITHER A DOUBLE OR A VECTOR OF DOUBLE
MIN(STAT) - MINIMUM OVER ALL THE VOICES IN THE SONG - RETURNS EITHER A DOUBLE OR A VECTOR OF DOUBLE
COUNT(CRITERIA) - RETURNS THE NUMBER OF SONGS THAT SATISFY A CRITERIA

STAT :-

STATISTIC COMPUTATION : A PARTICULAR FEATURE AND/OR STATISTIC THAT IS ACQUIRED FROM THE SONG.
INPUT TO A STAT = SONG OR LIST OF SONGS
OUTPUT OF A STAT = A DOUBLE OR A LIST OF DOUBLE

CRITERIA :-

CRITERIA SATISFIED BY A SONG : A PARTICULAR MUSIC THEORETIC CRITERIA IF IT IS SATISFIED BY A SONG
INPUT TO A CRITERIA = SONG OR LIST OF SONGS
OUTPUT OF A CRITERIA = BOOLEAN VALUE

ALGEBRAIC OPERATIONS

&& / AND - SUPPORTS CONCATENATION OF STATS AND/OR CRITERION AND ASSERTS ALL OF THE INPUT MUST BE TRUE FOR OVERALL BLOCK TO BE TRUE
|| / OR - SUPPORTS CONCATENATION OF STATS AND/OR CRITERION AND ASSERTS ALL OF THESE MUST BE TRUE FOR OVERALL BLOCK TO BE TRUE
! / NOT - SUPPORTS THE NOT OPERATION ON A BOOLEAN RETURN, IDEALLY SUITED TO BE USED WITH CRITERIA
> - GREATER THAN, SUPPORTED FOR STAT, NOT DEFINED FOR VECTOR RETURNS
< - LESS THAN, SUPPORTED FOR STAT, NOT DEFINED FOR VECTOR RETURNS
* - DOT PRODUCT, OF TWO VECTORS OR SCALARS
